        1) Load different concentrations of ATP and calcium ions, but just run the model for a few seconds to get the bar graphs to register the initial chemical energy. Which setting seems to boost the chemical energy?<br>
        <br>
        2) Try to connect what is happening in the model with the moment when the graphs change.<br>
        <br>
        3) Try finding the model which produces the most electric potential energy. Can you figure out why?</p>
