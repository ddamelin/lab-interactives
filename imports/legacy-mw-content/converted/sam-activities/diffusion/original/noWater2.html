      <p>Osmosis is actually very similar to diffusion in that water will flow at a greater rate from the high WATER concentration area, to the low WATER concentration area. By putting the cell in a place that has a low concentration of salt or sugar, you are actually placing it in an area that has a higher concentration of water. So, water will be able to enter the cell faster than it can leave.</p></td>
