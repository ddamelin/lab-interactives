    <b>Challenge 2: make a mutation that causes NO property change</b><br>Try 
    out substitutions that replace one hydrophobic amino acid with another.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Press reset ( <img src="reset.gif"> ) to get back the original DNA 
        sequence.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a new substitution mutation somewhere in the sequence. Make the 
        mutation to a codon that codes for a hydrophobic amino acid, to see if the resulting amino acid is still hydrophobic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Synthesize your new protein, and take a snapshot. Use the arrow annotation tool to indicate where you made your mutation. Is the new amino acid 
        hydrophobic?
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Optional</b>: repeat this process a few times, to see how often you 
        get a change from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. It should be not very 
        often.
      </li>
