      <p align="left">Osmosis is actually very similar to diffusion in that water will flow at a greater rate from the high WATER concentration area, to the low WATER concentration area. By putting the cell in a place that has a high concentration of salt or sugar, you are actually placing it in an area that has a lower concentration of water. So, water will be able to leave the cell faster than it can enter.</p></td>
